You are @1, the blacksmith of Soronan, a small mountain village in the land of Reptoran.  Some years ago, you settled down here, drawn by the prospect of a peaceful village near rich veins of various ores.  All was well: the nearby mine produced plenty of metal for you to work on, and customers from both the village and passing caravans kept you pleasantly busy.
But times changed for the worse.  A great earthquake shook the countryside, shutting off access to both the mineral lodes and the route into Soronan.  The mines that supplied your business either collapsed or were shut down, due in no small part to the sudden influx of monsters.  The creatures came from the only remaining access to the mountain: a jagged rift, opened by the mighty tremors of the earthquake.
You've done your best to equip any villager brave enough, or foolish enough, to explore the rift, though lately volunteers are few and far between.  No one has returned with any report beyond horrific tales of mutated animals, undead abominations, or worse; and the ones the do come back are in the substantial minority.  Soronan's population is a fraction of what is once was, and there seems no hope of salvation from a bleak, but inevitable, fate.
You've finally had enough.  You've grown to like this little town, and you're not about to let some monsters steal away everything you've worked so hard for.  Arming yourself with your trusty hammer and apron, you prepare to eliminate this threat, or die trying...
