You are @1, the physician of Soronan, a small mountain village in the land of Reptoran.  For many years you've tended the ills of the townsfolk, which were rarely worse than sickness or the occasional broken bone.  Lately, though, your skills have become more sorely tested.
When the great earthquake opened a rift in the nearby cliffs, some of the stoutest villagers went to explore it, with disastrous results.  The few that returned came back grievously injured, often without their weapons but always bearing tales of woe.  Some dark spirit or energy had gripped the wildlife within, turning them vicious and hostile.  Worse still, strange and unknown creatures had joined their number - horrors, abominations, grotesque mockeries of men and beasts, and the dead brought to life.
Attempts to seal the rift have proven futile, and recently, the monsters have begun to emerge and terrorize your town.  Each assault has been beaten back, but the villagers are starting to lose hope.  What once were whispers and mutterings are now open fear and despair, and the village elder has had no answer for it.

The village is paralyzed with fear.  If anyone is to face this threat, it's you: a simple physician from a quiet mountain village.
This morning, you made up your mind.  You will venture into the rift, and find who or what is causing all of this trouble.  Armed only with your skills of healing, you decide to visit the elder first for guidance.  After that, the Labyrinth awaits...
