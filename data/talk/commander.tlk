There are undoubtedly many passages through the Labyrinth that bypass this installation, and we can't patrol them all, even if we did know where they all are - which we don't.

Originally I led scouting parties into the Labyrinth, but when we stumbled upon some sort of ancient settlement, we converted it into a permanent outpost - at least as permanent as anything is down here.  Our mission is to understand and control whatever theats lurk here.","entry":false,"response":[{"text":"You should try harder.
