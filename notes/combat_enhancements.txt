intrinsic DR (for creatures like skeletons)
healing potions
poison, both inflicting and healing
facing (last target)
brief status effects (off-balance, etc.) - in fact, this could be what separates stronger and weaker creatures; not overt damage/hp, but ability to make the opponent vulnerable
-more on this: player attributes (strength, etc.) wouldn't change damage or hitpoints, but rather give opportunities to stun, off-balance, inflict critical, and so on
-these could be skills as well, like in runescape, and could be opposed rolls, like in crush
-also, the player could have an attack style, and that would determine which opposed check gets made (stunning, critical hit, armor piercing, etc.)

As the player goes deeper, monsters should become more dangerous in different ways.  Think that elf fighting Morgoth, or Gandalf fighting the Balrog - there's no way they just got lucky sword stabs in.  And how are you supposed to beat up an elemental or vortex? Those things should be true forces of nature that you can't just defeat by hitting them with a stick.
Perhaps monsters could also work together - warriors engage, archers stay back, clerics buff.  That could be a source of difficulty from strategy, not strength; they'd be difficult until you figured out how to handle them.
Monsters should also have weaknesses, prompting the player to explore different combat styles.  This shouldn't be to the MM "auto-kill with the right attack" level, but there should be plenty of situations where the player would have difficulties unless they use the correct approach.

Perhaps in general, levels should be sparsely populated with monsters that are easy (enough) to kill and that respawn fairly often, but also contain harder monsters that can and should be avoided if the player chooses (hard hitters that move slowly, or powerful monsters that are sleeping, hibernating, or initially non-hostile - for the latter, think the dragons in Dragon Age 3).

Keeping in mind "Offer multiple sources of benefits" and "No 'required' items," monsters should generally be able to be killed by hitting them (even if it's ineffecient), and those that can't should have multiple ways of handling them.  While unkillable monsters (that is, ones with very specific weaknesses) should be rare, they should still exist, and the player needs to learn that sometimes you do just need to run.  Monsters like that should largely be slow, or perhaps be sleeping/hibernating upon first encounter? And perhaps their attacks could also be slow - you might see a glow on a group of tiles, then the next turn it intensifies, then the next it blasts for huge damage.

Undead - strong against slash/piece weapons, normal against crush weapons, weak against dispel undead.
Ogres/giants/etc. - strong attacks that stun or weaken enemies, but slow (half speed, maybe).
	Though keep in mind that "hit, hit, step back, hit, hit, step back" isn't exactly engaging gameplay.

Opposed Checks:
 Compare skills, adding 1D25 to each.  Then resolve the result as follows:
  26 and up		High Success
  16 to 25		Med Success
  6 to 15		Low Success
  -5 to 5		Neutral
  -15 to -6		Low Failure
  -25 to -16	Med Failure
  below -26		High Failure
 Above presumes skills are on a scale from 0-100, and may need tweaking.

 50 levels higher guarantees high success, 40 levels higher guarantees medium success, 30 levels higher guarantees low success.
	50 + 1 = 51		40 + 1 = 41		30 + 1 = 31
	0 + 25 = 25		0 + 25 = 25		0 + 25 = 25	
 Same level rules out high success, 10 levels lower rules out medium success, 20 levels lower rules out low success.
	1 + 25 = 26		1 + 25 = 26		1 + 25 = 26
	1 + 0 = 1		11 + 0 = 11		21 + 0 = 21
  
When making an Aggressive attack, oppose Strength skills.
  Neutral or below: no effect
  Low Success: target is stunned (skip next turn)
  Med Success: target is concussed ("paralyzed"; skip two turns)
  High Success: target is concussed (as above) and free Combat check against target

When making a Finesse attack, oppose Combat skills.
  Neutral or below: no effect
  Low Success: good hit (add extra side to damage dice)
  Med Success: great hit (add extra die to damage dice)
  High Success: critical hit (add extra die, extra side) and free Strength check against target
  
There are two nice side effects to this system.  First, certain monsters like Ogres could be brutally strong, which wouldn't increase their damage necessarily, but they'd be smacking weaker players around at melee range and making them skip combat turns; in other words, you need to change your gameplay style to account for this.  Second, monsters could have bonuses to defensive checks, so while they wouldn't necessarily be more successful at attacking, the player would have a harder time hitting status effects on them.

Also, critical hits might be more than just increased damage; it might bypass armor instead.  This would be desirable for both increasing damage to the target and decreasing damage to the equipment that the player will (presumably) collect once killing the monster.
